# Robot-Mecahnics

### Project done as a part of Robot Mechanics course
This repository provides mini project implementations in Matlab for the class 'Introduction to Robot Mechanics' taught at New York University by [Prof. Kim Joo](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/joo-h-kim). These codes are based on programming problems given in the book [Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Craig-Introduction-to-Robotics-Mechanics-and-Control-3rd-Edition/9780201543612.html).

Please look into the [report](https://github.com/ShivamJoshi64/Robot-Mecahnics/blob/main/Report(2).pdf) for details.
